## Last Week's Accomplishments

- Created a sample repository with a ReactJS tutorial, split into very small
  discreet steps so that a utility script can parse through the changes and
  a curriculum developer can add instructions.
## This Week's Plan
- Continue wireframing the website.
- Continued development on the plugin GUI, fast-forwarding, etc.
- Translate curriculum brainstorms into commits.
## Anything Blocking?
- Things are running smoothely.
## Notes

- None.
